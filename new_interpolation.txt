Improved Iterative Text Expander Blueprint (2027 Edition)
Project Overview
An offline, training-free system that progressively expands text through iterative gap analysis. Starting with the first two sentences, it intelligently inserts relevant content from a document corpus between sentence pairs, repeating the process with newly formed adjacent sentences until optimal coherence is achieved.

Key Improvements from Previous Design

Iterative Gap Processing

Progressive insertion between new sentence pairs formed after each insertion

Depth-limited expansion (max 3 iterations) to prevent over-insertion

Context carryover between iterations

Dynamic Termination

Confidence-based stopping (no insertion if max score < threshold)

Novelty-based termination (stop when new inserts add <5% information)

Positional decay (diminishing returns for later insertions)

Context Accumulation

Rolling context window expands with each insertion

Weighted neighbor influence (previous inserts impact next decisions)

Efficiency Optimizations

Incremental indexing of inserted sentences

Candidate reuse across iterations

Batch gap analysis

Final Blueprint Specification
Core Architecture

Iteration Controller

Manages expansion depth and termination logic

Tracks insertion history and confidence decay

Enforces maximum expansion ratio (40% length increase)

Expansion Pipeline

python
current_text = initial_draft
inserted_count = 0
MAX_ITERATIONS = 3

for i in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
    sentences = Segmenter.split(current_text)
    if len(sentences) < 2: break
    
    new_inserts = 0
    expanded_text = sentences[0]  # Start with first sentence
    
    # Process all adjacent pairs
    for j in range(len(sentences)-1):
        # Retrieve bridge candidates between j and j+1
        candidates = Index.query_bridge(sentences[j], sentences[j+1], 
                                       context=expanded_text[-1000:])
        
        # Select best candidate meeting threshold
        best_candidate, score = Scorer.rank(candidates)
        
        if score > CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD and is_novel(best_candidate):
            expanded_text += best_candidate
            new_inserts += 1
            
        expanded_text += sentences[j+1]  # Always add next sentence
    
    if new_inserts == 0: break  # Termination condition
    current_text = expanded_text
    inserted_count += new_inserts
Component Enhancements

Document Selector: Pre-filters corpus to 10X draft length (resource optimization)

ANN Index: Maintains dynamic index of both source corpus and high-scoring inserts

Scoring Engine:

Progressive confidence decay (later inserts require 15% higher scores)

Insertion history awareness (prevents redundant content)

Context weighting (recent sentences have 2X influence)

Grammar Corrector: Runs minimally after final iteration (performance focus)

Termination Logic

Hard limits: Max 3 iterations OR 40% length increase

Quality thresholds:

Candidate score < 0.65 confidence

Novelty score < 0.2 (measured by n-gram divergence)

Contextual saturation: Last insertion improved coherence < 5%

Validation Metrics

Iteration Efficiency: Avg. 2.1 insertions per draft

Progressive Coherence: BERTScore should increase 8-12% per iteration

Termination Accuracy: 95% proper stop at optimal expansion point

Resource Profile: Linear memory growth < 120MB per 1K iterations

Example Workflow

Input Draft: "Mitochondria produce energy. Oxidative stress causes damage."

Iteration 1 Insert: "This occurs through the electron transport chain."
â†’ New pairs: [1-Insert] and [Insert-2]

Iteration 2 Insert: "Free radicals overwhelm antioxidant defenses" between Insert-2

Termination: No viable bridge between new pairs

Output: "Mitochondria produce energy. This occurs through the electron transport chain. Free radicals overwhelm antioxidant defenses. Oxidative stress causes damage."
